This project allows the user to interact with a password generating tool.
The application provides a streamlined way to quickly generate passwords within a set of requirements.

The goal was to set up a series of cascading prompts that define the different character types users want in a possible password (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters).

As a precaution, alert parameters are built-in to guide user through the password generation process (Such as a warning that passwords must be over 8 and below 128 characters).
